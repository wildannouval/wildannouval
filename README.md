# 👋 Hi, I’m Wildan Rizki

🎨 UI/UX Designer by passion  
💻 Coder by necessity (and coffee)

---

### 🚀 I Design & Code
From wireframes to `console.log("why is this broken?")`  
I love crafting interfaces that *don’t* make users cry.

---

### 🧠 Tools I Use (and occasionally argue with):
- `Figma`, `HTML/CSS`, `Tailwind`, `Laravel`

---

### 🤓 Fun Fact
I fix spacing on designs no one notices,  
but forget semicolons that break the entire app.
